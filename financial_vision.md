# Financial Vision

## 1) What does "$41.6B Dividend Pool per year" mean in the real economy?

Your Dividend Pool is basically "distributable free cash flow after reserves + minimum reinvestment."
In capital-heavy sectors (cars, telecom, power), the industry operating margins are often single
digits (and can be lower), and your model further reduces distributable surplus because you are
rebating users/workers and reinvesting for durability.

For anchoring: Bain notes automaker (OEM) margins dropping to about **3.9%** in Q3 2025. ([bain.com][1])
Your **Dividend Pool margin** could easily be **~1% of revenue or less** if you are serious about
"most surplus back to users/workers + heavy reinvestment."

So: **$41.6B/yr Dividend Pool** can imply **multi-trillion revenue** if your distributable margin is
under ~1%.

## 1.1) Surplus allocation and compensation fairness

The Dividend Pool is returned to **users and workers**, with no founder dividend. Founder compensation is treated the same as any other compensation and must remain within the published pay ratio policy.

**Comp math examples (10× median cap):**
- If median total compensation is **$120k**, the maximum total compensation for any individual (including the Founder) is **$1.2M**.
- If median total compensation is **$200k**, the maximum is **$2.0M**.
- If we want the Founder to make **$X**, then the median must be at least **$X / 10**—raising the floor for everyone.

## 2) A concrete "we sell most of everything" mix that hits the math

Below is a **Year 25-30 run-rate** mix that generates **~$41.6B/yr Dividend Pool**, while matching
your stated vibe:

- sell **most cars / phones / computers**
- be **most people's ISP**
- "maybe" be **most people's power company**
- meaningful space + humanoids (but note: launches alone do not move the needle)

I am going to peg "most" at **~60%** share unless stated otherwise, and I will explicitly choose very
low distributable margins (because otherwise you would blow past $20B easily if you truly dominate
these markets).

**Key takeaway:**

That is not insane if:

- you are pricing aggressively,
- you are reinvesting hard,
- you are doing large user rebates,
- you are in regulated-ish arenas (power), and
- you are capex-heavy (telecom/space).

## 3) The "rocket launches" reality check (because it matters for the mix)

Even if you sell "most launches," launches alone are **not** where the trillion-dollar wealth comes
from.

ESA estimates the **global launch + manufacturing** market at about **EUR 53B in 2023**, and the
launch segment is **~20%** of that (so on the order of ~EUR 10B). ([space-economy.esa.int][12])

So: **owning "most launches" is strategically massive**, but financially it is small compared to
cars/telecom/power. The money in "space" becomes meaningful when you also operate **satcom/satellite
internet/data services** at scale — which is why I modeled "space" as a broader satcom/services line,
not just launches. ([Space Foundation][7])
