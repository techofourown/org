# Mission

Tech of Our Own exists to build **non-extractive consumer technology** that makes people more capable, more private, and more free.

We do this by:
- Shipping local-first products that keep personal data and computation under the user’s control.
- Building in public: open-source by default, auditable security, and shared knowledge.
- Designing for long life: repairability, upgrade paths, and long-term support.
- Refusing dependency business models: **no subscriptions**, no hostage mechanics, no selling user data.
- Structuring governance so **users and workers are represented and benefit**—and so the company cannot quietly drift into becoming “them.”
- Returning surplus to users and workers with no founder toll, and keeping pay within a published ratio.

Our first flagship product is **OurBox**, and the mission extends to any future product category where people need technology that respects them.
