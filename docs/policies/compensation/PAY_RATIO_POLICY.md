# Compensation Ratio Policy
**Draft v1.0**

## 1) Purpose
TOOO commits to a single, legible compensation fairness rule that applies to everyone, including the Founder, and cannot be evaded through outsourcing.

## 2) Definitions
### 2.1 Total compensation
"Total compensation" includes:
- salary or wages
- bonuses (including retention or signing)
- equity vesting (valued at the grant-date fair value for each tranche)
- cash distributions
- executive perks (car allowance, housing allowance, security, travel stipends)
- any side agreements paid by TOOO

### 2.2 Included persons
The ratio pool includes:
- all employees (full-time and part-time), and
- long-term contractors or vendors providing recurring labor.

Anyone who works **more than 400 hours in a calendar year** for TOOO or fills a recurring role (e.g., weekly engagement) is included as a full-time equivalent (FTE) based on hours worked.

## 3) The rule
The highest total annual compensation must be **no more than 10×** the **median total annual compensation** in the ratio pool (FTE-adjusted).

## 4) Measurement method
- Compensation is measured on a calendar-year basis.
- Equity is valued at the grant-date fair value for each vesting tranche in the measurement year.
- Contractors are converted to FTE equivalents based on hours worked and included in the median calculation.

## 5) Disclosure
TOOO publishes an annual **Compensation Ratio Report** that includes:
- the ratio number,
- the measurement method,
- confirmation of compliance,
- aggregated distribution data (no individual disclosure).

## 6) Exceptions (rare and time-limited)
Exceptions are permitted only for emergency retention and require:
- a supermajority vote of the Board,
- a written, time-limited justification,
- disclosure in the Compensation Ratio Report.

## 7) Anti-evasion
Outsourcing or reclassification does not remove a person from the ratio pool if they meet the inclusion criteria. TOOO will not structure contracts or vendors to evade this policy.

## 8) Vendor fair work (preference)
For recurring labor vendors (e.g., cleaning, security, support), TOOO will prefer vendors that meet living-wage standards and fair scheduling practices.

## 9) Enforcement
The Board (through its People & Compensation Committee) enforces this policy, audits inputs, and ensures Founder compensation is set with required recusal.
