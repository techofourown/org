# Tech of Our Own Constitution
**Draft v1.0**

## 1) Preamble
Tech of Our Own (“TOOO”) is built as an alternative to extractive consumer technology. We exist to prove that privacy, autonomy, durability, and usability can win—at scale—without turning users into a resource.

This Constitution describes the mission, non-negotiables, governance, and economic rules that define TOOO. Formal legal documents must implement and be consistent with this Constitution.

## 2) Purpose
TOOO exists to build and maintain non-extractive consumer technology that increases human autonomy and privacy—starting with **OurBox**, a local-first personal server and personal AI system people can actually own.

## 3) Non-negotiables
The following are constitutional “never” rules. They are not suggestions.

1. **No subscriptions. Ever.**
   TOOO will not require or offer recurring subscription fees for consumer features, access, reliability, updates, remote access, security, or core functionality.

2. **Local-first forever.**
   Core product functionality must work locally without dependence on TOOO-operated online services.

3. **No hostage mechanics.**
   Users must never be forced to pay ongoing fees to access their own device, data, or essential safety/security functions.

4. **User data is not a product.**
   No sale of user data. No behavioral advertising. No hidden telemetry.

5. **Open source by default.**
   Core software is published under an open-source license, with a commitment to auditable security and reproducible processes where practical.

6. **Exit-to-self-sufficiency.**
   Products should enable people and communities to be self-sufficient over time: exportability, interoperability, and the ability to operate without TOOO.

7. **Right to repair and long-life design.**
   TOOO designs for durability, publishes repair guidance where feasible, and supports replacement/repair pathways.

## 4) Stakeholders and representation
TOOO recognizes two stakeholder groups:
- **Users**: people (or households) who use TOOO products and/or services.
- **Workers**: employees and long-term contributors who build and maintain TOOO.

Users and Workers are constitutionally recognized stakeholders with representation and benefits as defined below.
The Founder holds defined constitutional roles (Founding Steward, Mission Guardian) but is not a dividend-bearing stakeholder class.

### 4.1 Membership (intentionally flexible)
TOOO will maintain a **User membership** and a **Worker membership** for governance and benefits.
- The exact method for identifying and enrolling members may evolve over time and must be defined in a Board-adopted **Membership Policy**.
- The Membership Policy must be privacy-respecting and must not require surveillance of personal behavior.
- Membership policy may expand as TOOO expands into new product categories and services.

## 5) Governance structure
### 5.1 Board of Stewards
TOOO is governed by a **Board of Stewards** of 7 seats:
- 3 seats elected by **Users**
- 3 seats elected by **Workers**
- 1 seat is the **Mission Guardian**

The Board exists to steward mission, integrity, safety, and sustainability. Day-to-day operations are handled by executive leadership.

### 5.2 CEO and executive leadership
In steady state, the Board appoints and can remove the CEO.

**Exception:** During the Founding Stewardship Period, CEO appointment/removal and other operational authority are governed by the Founder Stewardship Addendum.

### 5.3 Mission Guardian seat
The Mission Guardian exists to prevent “mission drift” into extraction.
- Initially, the Founder holds the Mission Guardian seat.
- The Founder may hold the seat for up to **30 years**, or until resignation, death, or removal for cause.
- After the Founder’s Guardian term ends, the next Guardian is selected by a process defined in Board Operations, requiring legitimacy from both Users and Workers.

## 6) Protected Matters
The following are **Protected Matters**. They require:
- majority approval of User-elected stewards (2 of 3),
- majority approval of Worker-elected stewards (2 of 3),
- and approval by the Mission Guardian.

Protected Matters include:
1. Introducing subscriptions or recurring consumer fees.
2. Making core product functionality dependent on TOOO-operated online services.
3. Selling user data, enabling behavioral ads, or adding hidden telemetry.
4. Removing open-source commitments for core product software.
5. Introducing lock-in by removing exportability/interoperability.
6. Any sale/merger/control-transfer that changes governance control or weakens the mission lock.
7. Granting outsiders any route to control (voting rights, veto rights, governance capture terms).

## 7) Annual Dividend (shared surplus)
TOOO will share surplus through a simple, understandable annual dividend.

### 7.1 Dividend Pool
Each year, TOOO calculates a single published number:

**Dividend Pool = Free Cash Flow − Required Reserves − Minimum Reinvestment**

- **Required Reserves** are the funds needed to keep promises (security, long-term support, warranty/repair obligations, operational continuity).
- **Minimum Reinvestment** is the baseline funding needed to keep products safe, repairable, and open.

If the Dividend Pool is zero or negative, the dividend for that year is zero.

### 7.2 Dividend split
The Dividend Pool is split into:
- 50% to the **User Dividend Pool**
- 50% to the **Worker Dividend Pool**

### 7.3 User Dividend
The User Dividend is paid as a **rebate proportional to eligible spending** (e.g., purchases of products/services), under a privacy-respecting process defined by policy.

### 7.4 Worker Dividend
The Worker Dividend is paid via payroll and/or retirement contributions under a published rule defined by policy.

### 7.5 Unclaimed dividends
Unclaimed dividends are handled by a published claim window. Unclaimed amounts are returned to mission reserves or a member benefit fund, subject to applicable law and policy.

## 8) Compensation fairness
TOOO adopts a binding **Compensation Ratio Policy** that limits total compensation disparity and applies to all individuals, including the Founder and long-term contractors.

## 9) Transparency
TOOO will publish, at least annually:
- Dividend Pool and distributions
- reserve funding status (met targets: yes/no)
- high-level financial summary (in plain language)
- governance report (elections, major votes, and policy changes)

## 10) Amendments
Amendments require supermajority approval of both User and Worker membership (by their respective voting processes), plus approval of the Board and Mission Guardian.

Amendments to Section 3 (Non-negotiables) require a higher supermajority threshold (to be set in bylaws) and must be treated as Protected Matters.

## 11) Dissolution and asset lock
If TOOO dissolves:
- open-source licenses remain in effect
- community-critical trademarks and assets must be transferred to a mission-aligned stewardship entity
- any patents (if any) must be licensed defensively to prevent enclosure of the commons

## 12) Adoption
This Constitution is adopted on the recorded Start Date and governs TOOO from that date forward.
