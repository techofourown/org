# Compensation Ratio Policy
**Draft v1.0**

## Purpose
This policy establishes a clear, enforceable compensation fairness rule that applies to everyone at TOOO, including the Founder. It prevents special economic treatment and keeps compensation legible, boring, and hard to game.

## Definitions
**Total compensation** includes all forms of value provided by TOOO in a given year, including:
- salary and wages
- bonuses and commissions
- equity vesting (valued at the time of vesting)
- cash distributions and profit-sharing
- retention bonuses
- executive perks (housing, car allowances, paid travel, etc.)
- any side agreements or special payments funded by TOOO

**FTE-equivalent** means a standard full-time workload. Anyone working more than **400 hours/year** or serving in an ongoing recurring role (e.g., weekly or monthly work) is counted in the ratio pool as an FTE-equivalent, regardless of employment or contractor status.

**Ratio pool** includes all employees plus long-term contractors and recurring labor providers meeting the FTE-equivalent definition.

## The rule
The highest total annual compensation of any individual in the ratio pool must not exceed **10×** the median total annual compensation of the ratio pool (on an FTE-equivalent basis).

## Measurement method
- Equity is valued at the time of **vesting** for the year in which it vests.
- All compensation is converted to annualized values for FTE-equivalent comparisons.
- The median is calculated across all individuals in the ratio pool.

## Disclosure
TOOO publishes an annual **Compensation Ratio Report** that includes:
- the ratio number
- the methodology used (including equity valuation timing)
- confirmation of compliance

Individual compensation details remain confidential.

## Exceptions
Exceptions are allowed only for emergency retention or critical continuity risk, and must:
- be approved by a supermajority of the Board in executive session
- be time-limited to a maximum of 12 months
- be disclosed in the annual Compensation Ratio Report

## Anti-evasion and outsourcing
- Long-term contractors and recurring vendors are included in the ratio pool as FTE-equivalents.
- TOOO will not outsource work for the purpose of evading compensation fairness.

## Vendor fair work (optional standard)
For recurring labor vendors (cleaning, security, support, etc.), TOOO will prefer vendors meeting or exceeding local living-wage standards.

## Enforcement
The Board’s People & Compensation Committee oversees compliance, and the Board is responsible for remediation if the ratio is breached.
