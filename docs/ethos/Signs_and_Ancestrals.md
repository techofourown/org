## Purpose

This document serves to lay out the foundational **Eight Signs** that guide the actions, behaviors, and values we uphold at Tech of Our Own. These Signs embody the practices we invite our users to integrate into their lives. Each Sign represents an essential action and purpose, grounded in sovereignty, human dignity, and the reclamation and celebration of self.

Also included are the **Ancestrels**—the archetypal figures that embody these Signs. The Ancestrels are not just metaphors but rather serve as models for the employees and users of Tech of Out Own. Each Ancestrel names the role our tools play in the journey of the sovereign individual.

## The Eight Signs: Defining Action

Each Sign represents an actionable practice we enter with ourselves and our users, encouraging meaningful, mindful engagement with technology.

### 1) The Sign of the Drum  
**Meaning:** Humans are not machines. Every system should start with the human body and the human good.  
**Practice:** Begin decisions with a “Drum check”:
- What human good are we serving?
- What human risk are we introducing?
- What boundary should automation never cross?

---

### 2) The Sign of Gathering  
**Meaning:** Your data and history should live in your custody, not trapped in platforms.  
**Practice:** Export, normalize into portable formats, and maintain a local archive you can search. Our gathered content should be protected by default, and shared only when we choose to share it. 

---

### 3) The Sign of the Voice  
**Meaning:** Truth and agency spread when people can speak clearly without becoming content cattle.  
**Practice:** Publish, teach, warn, explain—so others can see and act.

---

### 4) The Sign of the Whisper  
**Meaning:** Privacy and consent are normal. Not everything belongs in public or in logs.  
**Practice:** Use end-to-end encryption, we should exercise our ability and our right, and our skill to communicate in private.

---

### 5) The Sign of Building  
**Meaning:** We need tools that are inspectable, repairable, and forkable—so users aren’t trapped.  
**Practice:** Ship small, document well, keep it reproducible and adaptable. We learn to code, build tools for ourselves and those around us.

---

### 6) The Sign of Sustaining  
**Meaning:** The commons only survives if maintenance is funded, respected, and planned.  
**Practice:** Fund, maintain, document, triage, and steward long-term reliability. Donate. Support. Sustain.

---

### 7) The Sign of Cleaving  
**Meaning:** Exit must be real. Dependencies must not become cages.  
**Practice:** Make exit concrete: revoke access, migrate workflows, help others do the same. Reject cookies, delete accounts, opt out. 

---

### 8) The Sign of Listening  
**Meaning:** we should listen to each other.  
**Practice:** Invite others to share, and recieve their words as the gifts that they are.

## The Ancestrels: Embodiments of the Signs

The **Ancestrels** are the living embodiments of the Seven Signs. They are not merely metaphors; they represent the spirit of the community and the promise it holds for us. Each Ancestrel is a figure of purpose, carrying the wisdom and responsibility of their role in the journey toward sovereignty.

### 1) The Drummer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Drum  
**Role:** The foundational force, marking the rhythm of human-centered design. The Drummer ensures that every decision begins with a human heartbeat, guiding our tools to serve life, not distract from it. The Drummer remembers that they are human. 

---

### 2) The Whisperer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Whisper  
**Role:** The protector of privacy and consent. The Whisperer ensures that secrets and confidences are kept safe, that communication is private, and that the patterns we reinforce honor personal sovereignty.

---

### 3) The Gatherer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Gathering  
**Role:** The custodian of memory and history. The Gatherer gathers, organizes, and keeps what matters, safeguards it from theft and loss, and keeps what is ours, and what makes us ourselves, and what makes us a community.

---

### 4) The Voice  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Voice  
**Role:** The speaker of truth and light. The Voice is responsible for amplifying what is important, announcing their humanity, spreading strength and joy and warning. We are not alone when we speak to each other. Not content for the machine, but connections for each other.

---

### 5) The Smith  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Building  
**Role:** The creator and the builder. The Smith takes raw materials and shapes them into useful tools, and repurposes what is avalable to better serve humans. Our tools are designed to empower, create, and adapt, so we can forge our own future, and protect ourselves and what is ours.

---

### 6) The Sustainer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Sustaining  
**Role:** They support the builders, the voice, the drummer, the gatherer. The systainer uses their resources to support those who need them. The sustainer might not build, but the builder can not build without the generosity and care of the sustainer.

---

### 7) The Cleaver  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Cleaving  
**Role:** The liberator. The Cleaver ensures that users have the tools to break free from dependency, reclaim control, and migrate their data and workflows freely and securely. The Cleaver is the embodiment of true exit and freedom. The cleaver can also cleve together with healthy and respectful systems, such as the tools in their own control. They can bring together humans seeking healthy connection.
