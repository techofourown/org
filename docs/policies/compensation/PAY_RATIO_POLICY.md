# Compensation Ratio Policy
**Draft v1.0**

## Purpose
TOOO commits to compensation fairness that is legible, enforceable, and applies to everyone. This policy prevents pay disparities from becoming a hidden caste system and ensures founder compensation is bound by the same rule.

## Definitions
### Total compensation
"Total compensation" includes all economic benefits provided by TOOO, including:
- salary or hourly wages
- bonuses (annual, performance, retention)
- equity vesting (valued at grant-date fair value)
- cash distributions
- executive perks and allowances (housing, transportation, security, etc.)
- any side agreements paid by TOOO

### FTE equivalents and included persons
The ratio pool includes:
- all employees (full-time and part-time), normalized to full-time equivalents (FTEs), and
- long-term contractors who either:
  - work more than **400 hours per year**, or
  - serve an ongoing role with recurring responsibilities (e.g., weekly or monthly recurring work).

Contractors included in the ratio pool are counted as FTE equivalents based on hours worked.

## The rule (10× median total compensation)
The highest total annual compensation paid by TOOO must not exceed **10×** the median total annual compensation of the ratio pool (FTE-normalized).

This rule applies to every individual, including the Founder.

## Measurement method
- Equity is counted at **grant-date fair value**, amortized over the vesting period in the year of vesting.
- Total compensation is calculated on an annual basis and aligned to the fiscal year.

The Board may update the valuation method only with public disclosure and a one-year transition period.

## Disclosure
TOOO publishes an annual **Compensation Ratio Report** that includes:
- the ratio number (highest-to-median total compensation)
- the calculation methodology
- confirmation of compliance

Individual compensation data is not disclosed.

## Exceptions
Exceptions are not permitted except in emergency retention situations, and only if all conditions are met:
- supermajority Board approval (at least 6 of 7 seats)
- a maximum duration of 12 months
- public disclosure in the Compensation Ratio Report

## Anti-evasion
Outsourcing does not remove anyone from the ratio pool. Recurring or long-term labor relationships are included as defined above.

TOOO will not structure compensation, contracting, or subsidiaries to evade this policy.

## Enforcement
The Board’s People & Compensation Committee is responsible for:
- reviewing compliance annually
- recommending corrective actions if the ratio is exceeded
- confirming Founder compensation recusal procedures

Material violations must be disclosed in the annual report with a remediation plan.
