# Requirements Directory

Most work here will not need formal requirements. Use this area only if you must track traceability or comply with standards.

## When to use

- Traceability from requirements → implementation → tests
- Compliance (regulated, contractual, or safety-critical work)
- Formal verification plans or matrices

## Structure

- `system/` — system-level requirements
- `interfaces/` — Interface Control Documents (ICDs)
- `verification/` — verification plans and traceability

If you do not need this, you can ignore it. The validation scripts are not enabled by default.
