# Founder Stewardship Addendum
**Pure Founder Control (Years 0–10) — Draft v1.0**

This Addendum defines a time-limited “founder-led” period designed for speed, pivots, and world-changing ambition—while keeping TOOO permanently blocked from extractive business models.

Where this Addendum conflicts with the Constitution, this Addendum governs **only during the Founding Stewardship Period** and only for **non-Protected** matters.

## 1) Founding Steward and the Founding Stewardship Period
- The Founder (Johnny) holds the office of **Founding Steward**.
- The **Founding Stewardship Period** is **10 years** starting on the Constitution’s Start Date.

## 2) What “Pure Founder Control” means
During the Founding Stewardship Period, the Founding Steward has final authority over all non-Protected operational decisions, including:
- Starting, pausing, or canceling products and R&D programs
- Entering or exiting markets (phones, appliances, vehicles, robotics, etc.)
- Hiring, firing, reorganizing, and compensation decisions
- Pricing, distribution, partnerships, and commercial strategy
- Capital and financing decisions (borrowing, debt, major commitments)

The Founding Steward may delegate authority to others (CEO, CTO, GM, etc.), and may revoke that delegation at will during the Founding Stewardship Period.

**Titles are optional. Authority comes from the Founding Steward office.**

## 3) CEO appointment and removal during the Founding Stewardship Period
During the Founding Stewardship Period:
- The Founding Steward appoints the CEO (if any).
- The CEO serves at the will of the Founding Steward.
- The Board of Stewards does not appoint or remove the CEO during this period.

## 4) Limits that still apply during the Founding Stewardship Period
The Founding Steward is still bound by the Constitution’s **Non-negotiables** and **Protected Matters**.

In particular:
- No subscriptions / no recurring consumer fees
- No hostage mechanics
- No sale of user data / behavioral ads / hidden telemetry
- No removal of open-source commitments for core software
- No lock-in by removing exportability/interoperability
- No sale/merger/control-transfer that weakens mission lock
- No outsider route to control
- Founder compensation is governed by the Compensation Ratio Policy and determined through the Board process with Founder recusal.

Attempts to relabel prohibited practices (e.g., calling a subscription a “maintenance fee”) are violations.

## 5) Board role during the Founding Stewardship Period
The Board exists and elections proceed, but the Board’s binding role is limited to:
- enforcing Protected Matters
- approving and publishing the annual Dividend Pool calculation and distributions
- enforcing transparency obligations
- initiating removal for cause of the Founding Steward (rare)

The Board may advise on strategy and risk, but cannot veto ordinary operational decisions during this period.

## 6) Removal of the Founding Steward (“not for snacks”)
The Founding Steward can be removed during the Founding Stewardship Period only **for cause**, defined narrowly as:
- attempted or actual violation of Protected Matters
- fraud, theft, or material financial deception
- serious criminal conduct that materially undermines the company
- persistent refusal to comply with binding Board decisions on Protected Matters
- permanent incapacity

Strategy disagreements, unpopular pivots, or personality conflicts are not cause.

Removal requires a high bar:
- dual-majority of User-elected and Worker-elected stewards, and
- confirmation by both User and Worker membership voting processes (thresholds set in bylaws)

## 7) Sunset
At the end of 10 years:
- the Founding Steward office expires automatically
- full steady-state governance applies (Board appoints/removes CEO, normal oversight)
- the Founder may continue in any role (CEO, CTO, board steward, etc.) only through ordinary processes

## 8) Founder roles and options (non-binding guidance)
The Founder may choose different operating modes across time:
- **Builder mode:** Founder leads product/engineering directly.
- **Operator delegation:** Founder hires an operator CEO while directing strategy.
- **Steward mode:** Founder steps back from operations while protecting mission.

The structure is designed so the Founder can pivot between these modes during the Founding Stewardship Period without rewriting governance.
