# Compensation Ratio Policy
**Draft v1.0**

## Purpose
This policy establishes a single, legible compensation fairness rule that applies to everyone at TOOO, including the Founder, and cannot be bypassed through outsourcing.

## Definitions
### Total compensation
"Total compensation" includes all forms of value provided by TOOO for a given year, including:
- salary and wages
- cash bonuses and retention bonuses
- equity vesting (valued at grant date and applied on the vesting schedule)
- cash distributions
- executive perks and allowances (housing, transportation, travel stipends, etc.)
- any side agreements or payments made by TOOO or on TOOO’s behalf

### FTE equivalents
Compensation is calculated on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis to keep comparisons consistent.

### Included persons (employees and long-term contractors)
The ratio pool includes:
- all employees (full-time and part-time), and
- any contractor or vendor-provided worker who:
  - works more than **400 hours in a year**, or
  - serves in an ongoing recurring role (e.g., weekly or monthly recurring work).

## The rule (10× median)
The highest annual total compensation for any individual must not exceed **10×** the median annual total compensation of the included pool (FTE basis).

This rule applies to all individuals, including the Founder.

## Measurement method
- The median is calculated from the included pool on an annual basis.
- Equity is valued at grant date and applied proportionally as it vests.
- All elements of total compensation must be included consistently year over year.

## Disclosure
TOOO will publish an annual Compensation Ratio Report that includes:
- the ratio number,
- the calculation methodology, and
- confirmation of compliance.

Individual compensation figures will not be disclosed.

## Anti-evasion rules
- Outsourcing does not remove individuals from the ratio pool if they meet the included-person thresholds.
- Compensation cannot be shifted into perks, side agreements, or off-ledger arrangements to evade the ratio.

## Exceptions
Exceptions are allowed only for emergency retention and must meet all of the following:
- a supermajority vote of the Board,
- a written, time-limited waiver (maximum 12 months), and
- public disclosure in the Compensation Ratio Report.

## Enforcement
- The People & Compensation Committee monitors compliance and prepares the annual report.
- The Board approves the Compensation Ratio Report and records any exceptions.
