## Purpose

This document offers a shared ethical language for living in the modern technological world: the **Eight Signs**—eight practical
ways to orient our choices toward human dignity, agency, privacy, and long-term freedom. They guide the actions, behaviors, and values we uphold at Tech of Our Own, and embody the practices we invite our users to integrate into their lives. Each Sign represents an essential action and purpose, grounded in sovereignty, human dignity, and the reclamation, defence, and promotion of the self.

These Signs are offered as a **commons gift**. You may copy, translate, annotate, remix, and teach
them—including commercially—so long as you **give credit** and **indicate changes** (as required by
CC BY 4.0). We want these practices to travel.

Also included are the **Ancestrels**— archetypal figures that embody each Sign, and with whom we may relate and identify. They’re a memory tool: a way to build intuition for the behaviours that can keep us safe and well.

## The Eight Signs: Defining Action

Each Sign is an actionable practice we can adopt—individually, in personal relationships, families, groups, teams, and in communities—to keep ourselves and our technology aligned with the human good.

### 1) The Sign of the Drum  
**Meaning:** Humans are not machines. Every system should start with the human body and the human good.  
**Practice:** Begin decisions with a “Drum check”:
- What human good are we serving?
- What human risk are we introducing?
- What boundary should automation never cross?


---

### 2) The Sign of Gathering

**Meaning:** Our history, memories, and identity are _ours_. They are too precious to scatter across platforms that neither know us nor have our best interests at heart. Gathering is a responsible act of self-respect and self-care, and is a choice to cherish and safeguard what should be in our personal stewardship.
**Practice:** Cultivate rituals of care and responsibility around our personal information and story:

* Recognize our history and identity as extensions and manifestations of ourselves, as vital resources, worthy of our protection and respect.
* Treat our memories, posts, sensor data, and digital fingerprints and footprints as high-stakes and sensitive treasures that deserve our mindful care.
* Choose intentionally when and how our stories are shared, ensuring our voice, identity, and dignity remain firmly within our hands.

---

### 3) The Sign of the Voice

**Meaning:** Using our voice is how we can connect with each other. Our voice is the signal we put into a world that can mediate and dilute it for the profits of those who control the spaces where we communicate. When we speak, we don't simply do it to serve the platforms which monetize the engagement of ourselves and our audience, but we speak with our voices to nourish, inspire, support, and encourage, to express truths that matter to us as individuals, and to affirm the humanity and standing of those marginalized and vulnerable around us. We speak to share joy, and when necessary, raise alarm and attention of those who can improve and protect those who are in need. We amplify our shared humanity. We use our voice responsibly to honor the power of empathy and expression.

**Practice:** Cultivate intentional practices around our voice that strengthen connections and deepen understanding and appreciation:

* We recognize our words as consequential and a reflection of what is good within us. We use our voice to uplift, comfort, and empower, rather than cheapen our gift of speech to extract attention and value from our audience, or deceive. 
* When we choose to share, to share with authenticity, adding to the wisdom and experience of others. When we can, we use our physical voices to speak directly and in person to those around us, bringing warmth and human connection to a world increasingly isolated by our digital echo chambers.
* We reject and avoid manipulation and extraction by algorithms and platforms. We dont want our voice to be appropriated as a commodity to be selectively shaped, mined, and processed by platforms to manipulate others, rather we seek to be a source of strength, warmth, dignity, and unity.

### 4) The Sign of the Whisper  
**Meaning:** Privacy and consent are normal. Not everything belongs in public—or in logs.  
**Practice:** Treat private communication as a baseline human right:
- Use end-to-end encryption where appropriate.
- Minimize data collection.
- Practice consent in what you store, share, and record.

---

### 5) The Sign of Building  
**Meaning:** We need tools that are inspectable, repairable, and forkable—so users aren’t trapped.  
**Practice:** Build in ways that keep power distributed:
- Ship small; document well.
- Prefer reproducible, legible systems over clever opacity.
- Teach each other to build; build tools for ourselves and our communities.

---

### 6) The Sign of Sustaining  
**Meaning:** The commons only survives if maintenance is funded, respected, and planned.  
**Practice:** Make long-term care a real line-item:
- Fund maintenance.
- Document and triage.
- Steward reliability and safety over time.
- Donate, support, sustain—help keep shared tools alive.

---

### 7) The Sign of Cleaving  
**Meaning:** Exit must be real. Dependencies must not become cages.  
**Practice:** Make leaving possible, safe, and humane:
- Make export, revocation, and migration concrete.
- Avoid lock-in defaults; prefer interoperable systems.
- Help others leave harmful systems when they’re ready.

---

### 8) The Sign of Listening  
**Meaning:** Listening is a duty. We learn from each other, especially when we are wrong.  
**Practice:** Invite others to share, and receive their words as the gifts that they are:
- Build feedback paths that are safe for the vulnerable and honest for the powerful.
- Treat critique as data, not betrayal.
- Respond with repair: acknowledge, change, and follow through.

## The Ancestrels: Embodiments of the Signs

The **Ancestrels** are archetypal roles that help people remember and practice the Signs. They are
not official positions and do not require affiliation with any organization. You can rename them,
reinterpret them, or translate them—keep what is useful.

Each Ancestrel names a way of holding responsibility in the work of humane technology.

### 1) The Drummer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Drum  
**Role:** The keeper of the human heartbeat. The Drummer ensures every decision begins with the human
good and ends before the boundary where automation harms dignity.

---

### 2) The Gatherer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Gathering  
**Role:** The custodian of memory. The Gatherer helps people keep what matters in their own custody:
portable, searchable, protected, and shareable by consent.

---

### 3) The Voice  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Voice  
**Role:** The speaker who refuses extraction. The Voice teaches, warns, explains, and amplifies what
matters—without turning people into content for the machine.

---

### 4) The Whisperer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Whisper  
**Role:** The protector of privacy and consent. The Whisperer treats confidentiality as normal and
builds systems that minimize surveillance and unnecessary exposure.

---

### 5) The Smith  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Building  
**Role:** The maker of tools that people can understand and keep. The Smith shapes what is available
into what is useful, and designs so users can repair, modify, and fork their way to freedom.

---

### 6) The Sustainer  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Sustaining  
**Role:** The steward of long-term care. The Sustainer makes maintenance real—through funding,
planning, documentation, and the quiet work that keeps the commons alive.

---

### 7) The Cleaver  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Cleaving  
**Role:** The liberator and the joiner. The Cleaver ensures exit is real: revoke access, migrate
workflows, break dependency. The Cleaver also knows how to cleave *together*—helping people build
healthy, respectful connections and systems on their own terms.

---

### 8) The Listener  
**Sign(s) Embodied:** Listening  
**Role:** The witness and the learner. The Listener builds spaces where truth can be spoken safely,
and helps communities turn feedback into repair, accountability, and better choices.

## Conclusion

The **Eight Signs** are a set of practices for humane technology—usable by individuals, teams,
communities, and organizations. The **Eight Ancestrels** are optional archetypes that help keep those
practices vivid and memorable.
