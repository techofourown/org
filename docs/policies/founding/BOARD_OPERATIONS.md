# Board of Stewards — Operating Rules
**Draft v1.0**

This document defines how the Board of Stewards operates in practice. It is intended to be readable, stable, and non-bureaucratic.

## 1) Composition
The Board has 7 seats:
- 3 elected by Users
- 3 elected by Workers
- 1 Mission Guardian

## 2) Meeting cadence
- Regular meetings: at least **every six monthly**
- Special meetings: called by the Chair, CEO, or any 2 Stewards
- Emergency meetings: may be called with shorter notice when safety, security, or solvency is at risk

## 3) Chair and facilitation
- The Board elects a Chair from among the elected Stewards (not the Guardian) for 1-year terms.
- The Chair sets agendas, ensures time discipline, and manages votes.
- The CEO attends meetings unless the Board is in executive session.

## 4) Quorum
Quorum requires at least 5 seated members present, including:
- at least 2 User Stewards, and
- at least 2 Worker Stewards.

## 5) Voting rules
### 5.1 Routine matters
Routine matters pass by simple majority of votes cast by seated members present.

### 5.2 Protected Matters
Protected Matters require:
- majority approval of User-elected Stewards (2 of 3),
- majority approval of Worker-elected Stewards (2 of 3),
- and Guardian approval.

## 6) Executive sessions
The Board may enter executive session (without the CEO) to discuss:
- CEO performance and compensation
- sensitive security matters
- conflicts of interest
- legal disputes

A summary of executive session topics should be recorded without disclosing sensitive details.

## 7) Conflicts of interest and recusals
- All Stewards must disclose material conflicts (vendor ties, competing businesses, significant personal benefit).
- A conflicted Steward must recuse from votes where the conflict is material.
- The Chair ensures recusals are recorded.
- Founder compensation decisions require:
  - recommendation from the People & Compensation Committee,
  - Board approval in executive session, and
  - Founder recusal recorded in the minutes.

## 8) Committees (lightweight)
The Board maintains four standing committees:
1) **Security & Privacy Committee**
   - ensures security posture, audits, incident response readiness
2) **Audit & Sustainability Committee**
   - reviews reserves, dividend pool calculation, financial risk
3) **Governance & Community Committee**
   - oversees elections, membership policy proposals, transparency
4) **People & Compensation Committee**
   - recommends compensation bands, including Founder compensation
   - verifies compliance with the Compensation Ratio Policy
   - prepares the annual Compensation Ratio Report

Committees make recommendations; the Board decides.

## 9) Transparency
The Board publishes at least annually:
- a plain-language governance report
- major votes and policy changes
- the dividend pool and distributions
- reserve funding status (met targets: yes/no)
- the Compensation Ratio Report (ratio number, method, and compliance confirmation)

Minutes should be recorded for all meetings. Sensitive details may be redacted for security/privacy.

## 10) Elections (high level)
- Users elect User Stewards through the User membership process.
- Workers elect Worker Stewards through the Worker membership process.
- Election procedures are specified in a Board-adopted policy and must be simple and privacy-respecting.

## 11) Guardian transition (after founder guardian term)
If the Founder no longer holds the Guardian seat (after 30 years, resignation, or removal for cause), the Board selects the next Guardian per the Constitution:
- candidates must be mission-aligned and independent
- selection must have legitimacy from both Users and Workers

The selection process must be published and must avoid capture by any single constituency.
